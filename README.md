# SAFWin (Setup And Fix Windows 10)
The goal here is to make a utility that will ultimately Setup And Fix Windows 10. 
While there are other one-click solutions that do a pretty good job of removing all the bloat from Windows 10, such tools are not always allowed, and even frowned upon in some work environments. 

Let's say you just replaced the hard drive on a desktop or a laptop, and have to set everything back up. This is intended to be as close to a one-stop shop as you can get, with download links to most manufacturer pages to check for drivers and BIOS updates.

Let's say you were handed a laptop from someone else, loaded up with viruses. This cannot remove the viruses, but once an antivirus program has been run successfully this can run the Windows commands to repair Windows 10. 

I want to make this as useful as possible while still being user friendly. Maybe eventually this could be a tool that you would let Grandma use on her PC.
