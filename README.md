# SAFWin (Setup And Fix Windows 10)
The goal here is to make a utility that will ultimately Setup And Fix Windows 10. 
While there are other one-click solutions that do a pretty good job of removing all the bloat from Windows 10, such tools are not always allowed, and even frowned upon in some work environments. 

Let's say you just replaced the hard drive on a desktop or a laptop, and have to set everything back up. Once you install Windows 10 and make it to the Desktop, you can run this, and just click the buttons to download the latest updates for windows 10, set the timezone, Download updater utilities from your device's manufacturer, and use the download links directly to Firefox and Chrome.

Let's say you were handed a laptop from someone else, loaded up with viruses. This cannot remove the viruses, but once an antivirus program has been run successfully this can run the Windows commands to repair Windows 10. 

I want to make this as useful as possible while still being user friendly. Maybe eventually this could be a tool that you would let Grandma use on her PC.
